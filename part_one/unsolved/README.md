# Hangman Part One Instructions
- When the page first loads
	- set a random word to all underscores and display it on the dom
	- set the number of guesses to 5 and display it on the dom
	- set the user's guesses to an empty array and display it on the dom
- If you guess a letter in the random word, it will replace the underscore(s) with that letter
- if the letter that you guessed is not in the random word, then Guesses left goes down 1
- If guesses left is less than 1, then you lose and you reset the game with a new random word to all underscores
- If you have filled all of the underscores, then you have won and you reset the game with a new random word to all underscores
- You can only guess one letter
- You can not guess a letter that has already been guessed
